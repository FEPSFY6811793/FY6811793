This paper presents a novel adaptive active learning strategy.The most accurate classification model from a heterogeneous
classifier pool is selected at each learning epoch. Our goal is to achieve greater incremental improvement in accuracy,compared
to using a single type of classification model throughout the process.The strategy is evaluated on benchmark data sets.
We further consider an application to texture classification problems in sonar mosaic imagery and compare it with non-adaptive
active learning and traditional machine learning approaches.Our results show that....We conclude that....

<p class="ex1">
<pre>
Modern science has been fundamental in the development of numerous cancer therapy methods that aim at either suppressing or curing cancer. 
The use of nanoparticles in drug delivery systems has proven to be more effective than traditional chemotherapy techniques. Drug Delivery Systems 
are methods of managing pharmaceutical chemicals to have beneficial effects on people. In targeted and controlled release strategies, nanoparticles 
are used in novel drug delivery systems that target cancer cells.

<p class="ex1">
<pre>
When it comes to drug delivery systems there are two main types - conventional drug delivery systems (CDDS) and novel drug delivery systems (NDDS), 
with the conventional system being the more commonly used technique. The way conventional systems occur are via oral, skin, and inhalation routes which 
typically have many advantages such as convenience, it is non-invasive, accurate doses, cheaper, higher compliance, and rapid absorption. Some hindrances 
of using conventional systems include low permeability and irregular absorption issues. Novel delivery systems are more advanced techniques with more 
recent dosage forms which are much better than the CDDS and involve medicinal devices which provide greater safety to the patient and targets the drug 
to the required cell with more accuracy making it more efficient. (insert image). The three types of novel drug delivery systems in which nanoparticles
are used are – controlled systems, targeted systems, and modulated systems. Targeted DDS is when the drug is delivered in a way that it is only active in the 
target area of the body in which the drug is released over a while in a controlled manner. Controlled DDS is when the release of a drug is for long periods, 
where the drug's rate of speed at which it is released is controlled by modification in the formulation. Modulated DDS is when the rate of drug release is 
controlled and modulated by devices, e.g., inhalers. Nanoparticles are usually incorporated with these delivery systems to improve transportation to the cell
by increasing the solubility and stability of drugs

  <h3 id="Properties of Nanoparticles">Properties of Nanoparticles</h3>
<p class="ex1">
<pre> Nanoparticles are tiny particles that can be created to carry and deliver medicinal products to specific places in the body. They typically range in 
size from 1 to 100 nanometers. Their small size provides various benefits in drug delivery systems, particularly in cancer treatment. Some characteristics 
of nanoparticles that make them optimal for drug systems are the high surface-to-volume ratio, great electrical conductivity and small size. (reference website).
A high surface-to-volume ratio can improve the specificity of chemical drug complexes in targeted therapy which means it will increase the efficiency of the 
nanomaterial treatment reducing its toxicity to normal cells.

         <h3 id="Application of Nanoparticles">Application of Nanoparticles</h3>
<p class="ex1">
<pre> Nanoparticles in delivery systems can be used in various ways to treat cancer such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy, gene therapy and immunotherapy. 
Chemotherapy is one of the most practised treatment methods for cancer as it is where medicine is used to kill cancer cells. Nanoparticles are starting to 
get used more in chemotherapy due to their small size and enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) to carry chemotherapeutic agents to the intended tumour 
cells (cite source) . The use of nanoparticles has a bonus in that it reduces toxicity and improves drug efficacy. Targeted therapy and Gene therapy are 
both methods of cancer treatment that are being in which targeted therapy involves specific sites to interact with molecular targets in the cell, and 
Gene therapy involves the interaction between pharmacological molecules and the genetic material of the cell. (cite reference) . The use of nanoparticles in 
gene therapy plays an important role in the treatment of different cancers as they can be effective drug carriers by improving circulation time, improving 
bioavailability, and improving the success rate in delivering the gene accurately (cite reference ). Immunotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that uses 
substances made by the body to boost the immune system and help find and kill cancer cells (cite reference). Nanoparticles can be used in immunotherapy 
treatment as delivery systems to safely transfer antigens for tumours over to lymph nodes by protecting them from degenerative enzymes in the body and 
effectively delivering them to the site. (cite reference).
